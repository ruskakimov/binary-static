The corresponding source code can be found in our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/binary-com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github repositories</a> that start with the prefix &quot;perl-&quot;. We welcome contributions to these repositories, notably improved documentation and test coverage.</p></div><div class="gr-padding-10"><h2>How will I get paid?</h2><p>We only pay for pull requests that are approved by our development team and merged into master. If the development team approves your pull request, we&#x27;ll pay you in cryptocurrency. You can choose Bitcoin, Litecoin or Ether. </p></div><div class="gr-padding-10"><h2>What can I expect to get paid?</h2><p>Our development team will determine how much you get paid. You can expect the following range of payments:</p><ul class="gr-row bullet"><li class="gr-6 gr-12-m">Trivial changes – generally $5-20</li><li class="gr-6 gr-12-m">Smallish changes – generally $20-50</li><li class="gr-6 gr-12-m">Average-sized changes – generally $50-250</li><li class="gr-6 gr-12-m">Medium-sized changes – generally $250-750</li><li class="gr-6 gr-12-m">Large changes – generally $750-2,500</li><li class="gr-6 gr-12-m">Very large changes/entire new projects – $2,500-10,000</li></ul></div><div class="gr-padding-10"><h2>Do I retain ownership of the code?</h2><p>No. Once your pull request is merged into master by our development team, and you have been paid, you have effectively handed over the rights to the code. It then becomes part of the master Binary.com codebase under the open-source license of the relevant repository.</p></div><div class="gr-padding-10"><h2>If rewards are not agreed in advance, how do I know I&#x27;ll be paid fairly?</h2><p>We want to keep improving our platform, so, it&#x27;s in our interest to pay contributors fairly. If we don&#x27;t, then you&#x27;ll stop contributing pull requests, which will make this project self-defeating.</p></div><div class="gr-padding-10"><h2>Can I work for Binary.com full-time?</h2><p>We are always on the lookout for talent – please apply via our <a target="_blank" href="/binary-static/br_mobile_full_screen_dialog/ko/careers.html">careers</a> page.</p></div><div class="gr-padding-10"><h2>Can I discuss the codebases with the Binary.com development team?</h2><p>Of course!
