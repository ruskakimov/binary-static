Industrial metals feature heavily across a wide range of industrial and commercial applications, including electrical wiring, automobiles, and batteries.</li><li>Precious metals<br/>Precious metals are harder to come by and are more valuable than industrial metals.

The most common influencing factors are:</p><ul class="checked"><li>Supply – Decline or increase in supply</li><li>Demand – Driven by industrial and commercial applications, including new technological products or fashion trends</li><li>Market volatility – Political, economic, or social instability may lead to more volatile financial markets that affect the prices of certain metals</li></ul><p>Keeping up with market news and trends in a certain sector can help you tremendously, especially if you&#x27;re just starting out.</p><div class="gr-padding-10"><div class="separator-line  "></div></div><h3 class="secondary-color">How to calculate your profits and losses</h3><p>Let&#x27;s use the XAU/USD metal pair again as an example.</p><p>Due to market volatility and gold&#x27;s reputation as a safe-haven asset, you predict that the price of gold will rise.</p><p>After you purchase one lot of XAU/USD at a price of USD 1,255.06, the price of gold increases and you decide to sell when it reaches USD 1,255.80. Your profit or loss comes down to the price difference multiplied by the total lots you purchased.</p><p>Your profit or loss is calculated as follows:</p><div class="gr-padding-20 fill-bg-color center-text primary-color"><p class="no-margin gr-padding-10 gr-parent"><strong>(Closing price – Opening price) x Lot units = Profitto/Perdita</strong></p><p class="no-margin"><strong>(1,255.80 – 1,255.06) x 100 = USD 74</strong></p></div><div class="gr-padding-10"><div class="separator-line  "></div></div><div class="gr-padding-20 fill-bg-color center-text primary-color"><div class="align-start gr-12"><div class="gr-row"><div class="gr-1 align-self-center"><div class="notice-circle">i</div></div><div class="gr-11"><p class="no-margin">Please note that one lot is equivalent to 100 units, based on our contract specifications.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sections invisible" id="margin-policy"><h2 class="primary-color">Margin policy</h2><p>Margin allows you to trade on leverage – giving you the same level of market exposure using much less capital.</p><p>For example, if you wanted to purchase 100 units of a particular asset trading at USD 50 per unit through a traditional broker, it would cost you USD 5,000 for this transaction.</p><p>With leverage, you can purchase 100 units of the same asset at a fraction of the cost.</p><div class="gr-padding-10"><div class="separator-line  "></div></div><h3 class="secondary-color">How to calculate margin</h3><p>You can determine the required margin for our metal pairs by using the formula below:</p><div class="gr-padding-20 fill-bg-color center-text primary-color"><p class="no-margin"><strong>Trade Size (Lot units) / Leva * Market Price = Margine</strong></p></div><p>For example, if you buy one lot of the XAU/USD pair at 300:1 leverage and a market price of USD 1,250.15, the margin required to purchase that one lot will be calculated as follows:</p><div class="gr-padding-20 fill-bg-color center-text primary-color"><p class="no-margin"><strong>100 / 300 * 1250.15 = USD 416.71</strong></p></div><p>Without margin, purchasing one lot of the XAU/USD pair will cost you:</p><div class="gr-padding-20 fill-bg-color center-text primary-color"><p class="no-margin"><strong>100 * 1250.15 = USD 125,015</strong></p></div><div class="gr-padding-10"><div class="separator-line  "></div></div><div class="gr-padding-20 fill-bg-color center-text primary-color"><div class="align-start gr-12"><div class="gr-row"><div class="gr-1 align-self-center"><div class="notice-circle">i</div></div><div class="gr-11"><p class="no-margin">Please note that one lot is equivalent to 100 units, based on our contract specifications.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="gr-padding-10"><div class="separator-line  "></div></div><h3 class="secondary-color">What&#x27;s a margin call and how is it applied</h3><p>When your account equity is unable to cover the margin requirement, your account will be placed under margin call.

This will lead to your pending orders being cancelled and your open positions being forcibly closed (also known as &quot;forced liquidation&quot;).</p><p>When your account hits the forced liquidation level, your orders and positions are forcibly closed in the following sequence:</p><ol><li>We analyse your pending orders</li><li>We delete an order with the largest margin reserved</li><li>If your margin level is still under the stop out level, your next order will be deleted.
