Uses client's time to set and check for expiry, as the expire durations are not so long to need a more precise one\n *    (And doesn't worth to wait for the response of time call)\n * 5. Some responses should be cached by a particular value from request (e.g. contracts_for_frxAUDJPY)\n *    so there can be more than one value for a particular call\n * 6. Clears the whole cache regardless their expire time on the following events:\n *    6.1. Client changes: login / logout / switch loginid\n *    6.2.
