Such individuals include Heads of State, Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries, Members of Parliament, Judges, Ambassadors, Senior Government Officials, High Ranking Officers in the Armed Forces, Audit Committees of the boards of central banks, and Directors of state-owned corporations. The “immediate family members” of the above examples will also be considered as PEP, and these include their spouses/partners, parents, and children. Additionally, “persons known to be close associates” of PEPs include their business partners, will also be considered as such. As a general rule, a person considered to be a PEP and who has ceased to be entrusted with a prominent public function for a period of at least twelve months no longer qualifies as a PEP.">What is this?</span></label></div></fieldset><fieldset id="fs_professional" class="invisible"><legend>Professional Client</legend><div class="gr-padding-10 gr-12"><input type="checkbox" id="chk_professional"/><label for="chk_professional">I want to be treated as a professional client.</label><a id="professional_info_toggle" class="toggle-arrow" href="javascript:;">What is this?</a><div id="professional_info" style="display:none"><div id="non_uk" class="invisible"><p>In order for us to be able to treat you as Professional Client, as a minimum, you have to satisfy two of the following criteria:</p><ul class="checked"><li>You have carried out transactions, in significant size, on the relevant market that we are going to offer you, at an average frequency of 10 per quarter of the previous four quarters; and/or</li><li>The size of your instrument portfolio (including Instruments &amp; Cash), with us or elsewhere, exceeds EUR500,000, or the equivalent; and/or</li><li>You have worked in the financial sector for at least 1 year in a professional position that requires knowledge of the envisaged transactions.</li></ul><p>By opting to be treated as a Professional Client, we shall not presume that you possess market knowledge and experience as defined by the term &#x27;Professional Client&#x27;.
